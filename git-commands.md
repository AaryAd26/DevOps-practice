# **List of Commands I am Using**

1. git --version -- used for cheking if git is installed if yes whats its current version installed.
for ex- when we open a new instance so we check that if git is installed or not 

2. git config -l -- used for setting up our git identity, name & email.
for ex - you are using a git file and you want to know who created this particular file so we use this command.

3. git init -- used for initializing a empty git repo
for ex - you created a new project and want eveybody can used that so you first have to start and initialize a git Repo

4. git status -- used to check that on which braanch we are currently working and also tell that if there any files that are unmarked and ready for commit.
